# WOLADDRESS: MAC address (aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff notation) of the box you

# Note: etherwake has to be installed

# XBMCDIR can be set to "tmpfs" to use the default behaviour of writing
# all changes to tmpfs or you can specify:
# * a NFS share prefixed with "nfs=" 
# * "nfs" or "NFS" to auto-detect the NFS share which is to be used
#   (NFS server will be the nbdroot server, path will be "/var/cache/mythbuntu-diskless/overlay/")
# * or a block device, eg /dev/sda1 (will be
#   interpreted by mount, UUID might work as well)
#
# Note: can be overridden with xbmcdir= boot option
# Note: default is "tmpfs"
# Note: If you're going to use NFS
# Examples:
# XBMCDIR="/dev/sda1/"
# XBMCDIR="nfs=192.168.0.1:/my/share/"
XBMCDIR="NFS"

# XBMCDIRKEY: valid options: "MAC", "HOSTNAME" or any string of your choice
# A new directory will be created inside the file system described by XBMCDIR.
# Its name will either be the MAC address of the NIC used to bring up your
# system ("MAC"), the hostname ("HOSTNAME") (as given out by your dhcpd or 
# as specified using the ip= boot option) or any other string you might
# have entered here.
# All changes you will make to the root file system will be preserved in this 
# directory and they'll be available even after reboots. That's the plan 
# at least, so make sure your backups are up to date.
# Note: can be overridden with overlaykey= boot option
# Note: this option is not used with XBMCDIR=tmpfs to preserve default behavior
# Note: XBMCDIRKEY defaults to "MAC"
# Note: If you're using MAC, colons will stripped from the MAC address
XBMCDIRKEY="MAC"

# HOSTNAMEOVERRIDE: set the hostname of the client to the overlay key
# If $OVERLAYKEY is used and you set this option to "true",
# the host name of the client will be set to the string represented by 
# $OVERLAYKEY (eg OVERLAYKEY="MAC" will set the host name to the MAC address
# without colons)
# Valid choices: "true", empty
# Note: can be overriden with hostnameoverride= boot option
HOSTNAMEOVERRIDE="true"

# DHCPPORT: tell ipconfig from klibc-utils) to use an alternate DHCP port
# Default: 68
# example: if you want to use alternate DHCP ports, use something like
# DHCPPORT="1068"
# this variable can be overridden using the dhcpport= boot option
# Your DHCP server will have to listen on $DHCPPORT - 1
# Note: for alternate DHCP ports, see
